## The Phrase Hunter Game:

  * The playerâ€™s goal is to guess all the letters in a hidden, random phrase. At the beginning, the player only sees the number of letters and words in the phrase, represented by blank boxes on the screen.

  * The player can choose a letter by clicking the onscreen keyboard or typing on their physical keyboard.

  * If the selected letter is not in the phrase, one of the player's hearts is removed from the screen.
  The player keeps choosing letters until they reveal all the letters in the phrase, or they make 5 incorrect guesses.
